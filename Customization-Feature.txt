# Feature customization of the Polymath's STO system

  - Please refer to the README file for a overview of the STO system.

  - Please be noted that the components of `new-polymath-...` are not in use.

## Disable STO creation fee

The following files need to be changed:

1. `polymath-core/migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js`

Used by the contract deployment process that will set the fees.

Replace the below snippet

```
const cappedSTOSetupCost = new BigNumber(20000).times(new BigNumber(10).pow(18));   // 20K POLY fee
const usdTieredSTOSetupCost = new BigNumber(100000).times(new BigNumber(10).pow(18));   // 100K POLY fee
const initRegFee = new BigNumber(250).times(new BigNumber(10).pow(18));      // 250 POLY fee for registering ticker or security token in registry
```

with

```
const cappedSTOSetupCost = new BigNumber(0);
const usdTieredSTOSetupCost = new BigNumber(0);
const initRegFee = new BigNumber(0);
```

2. `polymath-core/contracts/SecurityTokenRegistry.sol`

Disable the below code line number `183`. Otherwise, `SecurityTokenRegistry` deployment will be failed.

```
require(_stLaunchFee != 0 && _tickerRegFee != 0, "Fees should not be 0");
```
